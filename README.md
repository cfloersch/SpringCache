# SpringCache
A Spring HTTP Client Cache Implementation


The aim of this project is to provide a _lightweight_ client HTTP cache for the
[Spring Framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/), specifically
[RestTemplate](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html).
It’s implemented purely on top of Spring’s interfaces and doesn’t use any “heavy” caching library.

At this point this is highly experimental and still in the early active development phase
